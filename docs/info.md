## How it works

1) Configure the FPGA as you like (docu for the layout/bitstream coming soon).
2) Use it.

## How to test

Configure the FPGA as you like and see if it works.

## External hardware

You need some way to automatically stream a bitstream into the FPGA (alternatively, you can also put in all 444 configuration bits by hand). Any microcontroller should work just fine.
